                    The service begins upon signup. Upon signup, the login credentials provided to you, will immediately be functional, and those same credentials will be emailed to the address that you provided. Your login will be used for the web and mobile application. Your subscription will billed on a quarterly basis approximately every 90 days. Your billing statement will charge as our listing services. You can cancel anytime by visiting your Account Settings page or contact <a href="mailto:fiverrwalid@shopping.com">merchant@shopping.com</a>, or call <span style="color:#337ab7;"><i class="fa fa-phone"></i>&nbsp;+880-1789889898.</span> Canceling your subscription stops the charge at the start of your billing date-- but your service will continue through the end of your current term. You understand that if you cancel less than 1 day prior to the next billing date, you risk that your monthly payment may have already been processed, and that a refund will not be issued. I understand that canceling is solely my responsibility and the service is a recurring charge for the system and app access.
